**2. Project Title**. A clear and descriptive title for the project.
ParkSense: Utilizing Data Driven Approaches for Sustainable Parking Management in Schools.

3. Project Introduction that contains the project overview, purpose, and objectives.
	Through a number of features, ParkSense seeks to effectively manage parking spaces, improve customer experience, and optimize operations. These features address a number of requirements, such as resource allocation, revenue optimization, user convenience, and regulatory compliance.
	Its purpose and objective is to make parking operations efficient, satisfy users, and to automate the billing process. It can do this by the features it has, such as reservations, real-time occupancy tracking, automated billing, and analytics.

**4. Project Description.** An outline of the scope and limitations and constraints of the
project. This should also include the features it will implement and the problem it will
solve (if any). Include also the Sustainable Development Goal.
Problem Solved:
This project aims to solve the inefficiency and frustration associated with traditional parking management. It addresses issues like:
Limited parking availability: Difficulty finding available parking spaces.
Inefficient use of parking spaces: Faculty/staff parking in student areas or vice versa.
Lack of transparency and fairness: Unclear allocation of parking privileges can lead to frustration.
Traffic congestion: Caused by circling for parking spots.
Features:
Access Control:
Color Coding: Restricts parking based on car color (e.g., only red cars on Tuesdays)
Number Coding: Regulates parking based on license plate number (similar to color coding)
Permit Management: Streamlines long-term parking for permit holders
User Management (For Employees Only):
Reservation System: Allows staff to reserve parking during peak hours
Billing and Payment:
Automatic Billing System: Simplifies payment after parking sessions
History of Parking: Tracks parking transactions for users and administrators
Data and Analytics:
Real-time Occupancy Tracking: Displays available parking spaces
Analytics Dashboard: Generates reports on usage patterns, revenue, and peak hours
Accessibility and Enforcement:
Priority Parking: Designates spots for disabled individuals
Time Limit Enforcement: Automatically enforces parking duration and issues penalties
Departmental Management:
Departmentalized Parking: Allocates spaces and tracks usage by school department (CIT, CEAFA, CICS).
Scope:
This project focuses on developing a system for internal parking management. It will be used by parking administration staff only. Parkers will not directly interact with the system beyond receiving billing receipts.
Limitations:
User interaction is limited to parking staff.
The system doesn't offer functionalities for parkers like real-time space booking or mobile payments (these features could be considered for future enhancements).
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG):
This project indirectly supports SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities by potentially reducing traffic congestion caused by circling for parking. A more efficient parking system can lead to smoother traffic flow and potentially lower emissions.

**5. Methodology**. May include frameworks, tools to be utilized, or if there will be any
design patterns to be followed.
	We will use GitHub as it serves as the collaborative platform for version control and code management in the creation of the parking management system, enabling developers to store, track changes, and coordinate development efforts effectively. We will also use Windows Forms as our interface framework for easy-access for the users.

**6. Technologies.** A list of the technologies that will be used in the project, including
programming languages, libraries, databases, and any other relevant tools or platforms.
	C# will be the programming language used in this project. We will also use Visual Studio Code in creating the application. It’s possible that more technologies will be used as we get to know more about our project.

existing projects that have influenced or inspired the proposed project.

Proposal 1: 

ParkSense: Utilizing Data Driven Approaches for Sustainable Parking Management and SDG Impact

Features:
Color coding: Assigns whether each car is allowed to park on a specific day based on their car color.
Number coding: Similar to color coding,Assigns whether each car is allowed to park on a specific day based on their number plate.
History of parking: Records past parking transactions, providing valuable data for analyzing trends and identifying opportunities for improvement. Users can view their own history to track expenses or confirm prior visits, while administrators can analyze historical data to optimize parking capacity utilization, set dynamic pricing policies, and forecast demand.
Automatic billing system: Simplifies the payment process by automatically charging users' accounts after their parking session ends. An integrated automatic billing system minimizes transaction fees and reduces administrative overhead associated with traditional paper-based methods.
Reservation for staff members: Prioritizes parking availability for staff members during peak hours by setting aside dedicated spaces or allocating reserved blocks of time. This ensures essential personnel always have convenient parking options, improving employee satisfaction and productivity.
Priority parking for disabled persons: Designates special parking spaces close to entrances for individuals with disabilities. These spaces typically offer wider berths and easy access ramps, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and enhancing inclusivity. Clear signage and enforcement measures discourage unauthorized use of priority parking spots.
Departmentalized parking: Divides parking spaces according to departments or business units, enabling organizations to allocate resources efficiently and monitor usage statistics per department. By understanding how different groups utilize parking resources, companies can tailor policies to better serve their unique needs and encourage carpooling or alternative transportation modes where feasible. Additionally, this approach encourages fairness and transparency, helping prevent disputes related to parking allocation.
Real-time occupancy tracking: Provides real-time data on available parking spaces, allowing users to quickly find open spots and reducing traffic congestion caused by circling around for an empty space.
Time limit enforcement and automatic penalty: Automatically enforces time limits and sends alerts when it's time to leave or if additional payment is required.
Permit management: Manages permits for long-term parkers, including monthly pass holders or employees who work at nearby businesses.
Analytics dashboard: Provides insights into usage patterns, revenue streams, peak hours, and other key metrics, helping operators optimize pricing strategies and improve overall efficiency.
Electric vehicle charging station management: Incorporates electric vehicle charging stations within parking facilities and manages their operation and billing.
