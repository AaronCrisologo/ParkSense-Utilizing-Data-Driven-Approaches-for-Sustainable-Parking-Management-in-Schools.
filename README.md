##  2. Project Title
ParkSense: Utilizing Data-Driven Approaches for Sustainable Parking Management in Schools

## 3. Project Introduction
  📌Through a number of features, ParkSense seeks to effectively manage parking spaces, improve customer experience, and optimize operations in school parking lots. Its purpose and objective are to make parking operations efficient, satisfy users, and automate the billing process.

## 4. Project Description
Problem Solved:
  📌This project aims to solve the inefficiency and frustration associated with traditional parking management in schools. It addresses issues like limited parking availability, inefficient use of parking spaces, lack of transparency and fairness, and traffic congestion.

### ✔️Features:

Access Control:

	User Management (For Employees Only)
 
	Billing and Payment
 
	Automatic Billing System
 
	History of Parking
 
	Data and Analytics
 
	Real-time Occupancy Tracking
 
	Analytics Dashboard
 
	Accessibility and Enforcement
 
	Priority Parking
 
	Time Limit Enforcement
 
	Departmental Management
 
	Departmentalized Parking
 
 ### ✔️Scope:

 📌This project focuses on developing a system for internal parking management in schools. It will be used by parking administration staff only. Parkers will not directly interact with the system beyond receiving billing receipts.

 ### ✔️Limitations:

📌User interaction is limited to parking staff. The system doesn't offer functionalities for parkers like real-time space booking or mobile payments. These features could be considered for future enhancements.

 ### ✔️Sustainable Development Goal (SDG):

📌This project indirectly supports SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities by potentially reducing traffic congestion caused by circling for parking.

## 5. Methodology

📌We will use GitHub as the collaborative platform for version control and code management. Windows Forms will be used as the interface framework for easy access for users.

## 6. Technologies

📌Programming Language: C#
Integrated Development Environment: Visual Studio Code
